- Engineered features from the text of each column.
- Explored the data to analyze the relationships among the features (or variables).
- Built five different regression models - linear, lasso, ridge, random forest, and XGBoost.
- Optimized the random forest and the XGBoost model using GridsearchCV to find the optimal parameters.
